##### What does it do?
The inspiration for DrinkWise came from the devastating effects of drunk driving and the need to address this problem on college campuses. DrinkWise is a solution that combines both facial recognition and audio recognition technology to determine an individual's level of sobriety. This allows us to check if they are fit to drive a car. 

##### Features

DrinkWise is a web-app with two tests to detect sobriety:

- First is a face test, we trained this fully from scratch on a dataset of both drunk and sober people
- Second we analyzed spectrograms & used an algorithm called levenshtein distance to be able to detect whether a user is slurring
